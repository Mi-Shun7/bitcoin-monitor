### II. Technical Indicator Interpretation  
1. **Price Trends**: BTC trades sideways near $118K (July 14–20 range: $117K–$120K). No clear trend reversal signals; 30-day volatility decreased by 15% vs. June 2025.  
2. **Market Valuation**:  
   - Ahr999 (1.22): Neutral-bullish (accumulation phase). Below bubble territory (>1.4) but above undervalued zone (<0.95).  
   - Fear & Greed (72): "Greed" zone but cooler than June 2025 peaks (79).  
3. **Cycle Phase**: Uptrend consolidation. Bullish confirmation requires a close above $120K; bearish signal if $110K breaks.
