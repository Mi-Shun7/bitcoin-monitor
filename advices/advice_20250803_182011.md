### IV. Position Management Tracking  
**Current recommendation**: Increase Position to 60%  
- Position change: 45% → 60%  
- Fund allocation:  
  - Currently invested: $450 (45%)  
  - This operation: +$150  
  - Post-operation: $600 (60%)  
  - Remaining cash: $400  

**Cost Basis Calculation**:  
- New average cost: ($450×$116,522 + $150×$113,939)/600 = **$115,876**  

**Expected Returns**:  
- Short-term: $600 × 4.5% = **+$27** (+2.7% portfolio return)  
- Mid-term: $600 × 14.1% = **+$84.60** (+8.46% portfolio return)

### V. Risk Analysis  
1. **Downside volatility below $110k**  
   *Mitigation*: Strict stop-loss at $105k limits max portfolio loss to 5.6% ($56).  
2. **AHR999 falling below 1.0**  
   *Mitigation*: Pause accumulation until indicator stabilizes.  
3. **Macro risk events**  
   *Mitigation*: Monitor Fed policy shifts impacting crypto liquidity.  

---

### VI. Key Future Observation Indicators  
1. **$110,000 support**: Breakdown → Accelerate stop-loss execution  
2. **AHR999 <1.0**: Signal to prepare additional liquidity for strategic buying  
3. **Fear & Greed <40**: Trigger defensive rebalancing (reduce 10% position)
