### V. Risk Analysis  
1. **Downside Breakout**: Failure to hold $110k may trigger stop-loss. *Mitigation*: Strict adherence to $105k stop.  
2. **Prolonged Consolidation**: Capital tied below cost basis. *Mitigation*: Reserve 30% cash for sub-$110k opportunities.  
3. **Macro Shock**: External volatility. *Mitigation*: Monitor Fear & Greed; exit if drops below 40 (extreme fear).
