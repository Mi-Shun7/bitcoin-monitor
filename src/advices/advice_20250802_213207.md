### I. Market Cycle Analysis  
Bitcoin is in a **choppy market** transitioning from a bull phase to accumulation. Key resistance at $118,000 (July highs), support at $105,000 (June lows). AHR999 (1.09) nears the "value accumulation" threshold (<1.2), while Fear & Greed (55) reflects neutral sentiment after cooling from extreme greed (75 in July).  

---

### II. Technical Indicator Interpretation  
1. **Price Trends**: BTC fell 5.5% from July’s $119k peak to $113k (Aug 2), testing the 50-day moving average. Volume shows weakening bullish momentum.  
2. **Market Valuation**: AHR999 at 1.09 (below overvalued 1.2 threshold) signals undervaluation potential. Fear & Greed Index dropped from 75 (greed) to 55 (neutral), reducing FOMO risks.  
3. **Cycle Phase**: Transitioning from distribution to accumulation. Bullish exhaustion evident from failed $120k breakout attempts (July 21–28).

### III. Investment Decision Recommendations  
1. **Position Adjustment**: **Increase position** to 40% ($400).  
2. **Entry Price**: Buy $400 at current price ($113,310). If price drops to $105,000 (6% decline), add another 20% ($200).  
3. **Stop-Loss**: Trigger at $95,000 (-16% from entry), limiting max drawdown to 19% of total portfolio. Re-enter if AHR999 falls below 0.95.  
4. **Profit Targets**:  
   - Short-term (3 months): $125,000 (+10.3%). Trim 20% at target.  
   - Mid-term (6–12 months): $150,000 (+32.3%). Take profit in 10% increments every $10k gain.
